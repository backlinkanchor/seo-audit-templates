```

## Tool Integration Problems

### API Rate Limiting and Access Issues

**Issue: SEO Tool API Limitations**

**Symptoms:**
- Data export failures from SEO tools
- Incomplete datasets due to API limits
- Frequent timeout errors during data collection
- Inconsistent data between tool interfaces and API exports

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**For Ahrefs API Issues:**
```python
# Example rate limiting approach
import time
import requests

def safe_api_call(endpoint, params, delay=1):
    try:
        response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
        if response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limited
            time.sleep(30)  # Wait 30 seconds
            return safe_api_call(endpoint, params, delay*2)
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"API Error: {e}")
        return None
```

**General API Best Practices:**
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Cache API responses to avoid repeated calls
- Use batch requests when available
- Monitor API usage against monthly limits
- Implement error handling and retry logic

### Data Export and Import Challenges

**Issue: Large Dataset Handling**

**Symptoms:**
- Excel crashes when opening large CSV files
- Memory errors during data processing

✓ Consider Google Sheets for collaborative large data handling
✓ Implement data sampling for initial analysis
```

**For Database Integration:**
```sql
-- Example for creating manageable data subsets
SELECT * FROM audit_data 
WHERE domain = 'example.com' 
AND crawl_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
ORDER BY priority DESC 
LIMIT 1000;
```
